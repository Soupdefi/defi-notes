# The [Baseplate Thesis](https://mirror.xyz/samidefi.eth/UQ8_M77g4qx1CT0QH00GUTWViW41aSxX0V7MwetNb8I)

1. Protocols which function within a “closed-loop”, meaning their network incentives intrinsically lie only within the product are limited by the success of the protocol, and hindered by their own failures
    1. Whereas, “open-loop” protocols whose incentives can be built upon do not solely rely on themselves, they are boosted by those on top of them, functioning as the baseplate (ex. Curve, Curve’s shortcomings are fixed by Convex, whose further flaws are improved upon by RedactedCartel) 

2. Governance control is only desirable when there is adequate value created by network ownership across the entire ecosystem

## Fat protocol thesis:
  - In web2, the ‘protocols’ (HTTP, IP, etc.) create immense value, but majority of it is captured and reused at the applications layer, in the form of data (largely, ex. Google, FB, etc.), this creates ‘thin’ protocols, and ‘fat’ applications, where investing in applications brings high returns and investing in protocols brings marginally smaller ones.
  - In web3 / blockchain, this is reversed, value is concentrated at the protocol layer and only a part of that value is redistributed and shared along the application layer, thus creating fat protocols and thin applications

3. Open-loop economic feedback loops that are unresponsive to crypto-economical events have a great value than closed-loop feedback models1. 
    1. Open-loop models provide value, and from that value profit is derived for the user, whereas closed-loop models must contain a feedback channel, which leads to those without the proper incentive mindsets gaining dictation over the protocol (fulfilling the ‘numba go up’ mentality) 
    2. In the case of Curve, which functions using semi-immutable emissions schedules is the elimination of selfish feedback, rather seeking direction directly from the economic structure and monetary policy the emissions schedule is feeding
